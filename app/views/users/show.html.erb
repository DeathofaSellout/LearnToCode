  <h5> There are two pages to learn from: Javascript and Full Stack
    Web Development. The Getting Started page is what tools you will need
    before learning Javascript. Next, go to the Javascript page. Once you've learned
    all of the Javascript concepts, then you should move on to the Full Stack
    page. You have a place to keep track of your tasks/progress, called Tasks.
    Use Tasks so you know what you've learned and what you need to learn next.
    The Forum is a place to ask questions and get help. Learning how to
    properly google your questions, to find answers,
    is an important skill that every programmer utilizes. Always do that first,
    then go to the Forum. If you need help beyond
    The Forum, you can contact me for help. I do charge, but I am there if you
    need it. Have fun and study hard!
